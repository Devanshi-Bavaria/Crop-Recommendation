# Crop Prediction System

The Crop Prediction System is an advanced machine learning project designed to help farmers and agricultural professionals make informed decisions about which crops to plant. By analyzing various environmental and soil parameters, the system can predict the most suitable crop for a given set of conditions, thereby optimizing yield and sustainability.
